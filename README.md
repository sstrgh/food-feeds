# Food Feeds
Your favorite food feed plugin for wordpress

## Assumptions
Assumptions :  
1. Only 1 feed provider  
2. Date time provided has already been localised
3. Dont need to show all the details, but they are saved
4. Show only the last 5 entries

## Feature Suggestions
Things that I would have done if given alot more time:
1. Allow the admin to add multiple rss feed providers.
2. Allow a see more option, that can show more than the last 5 entries.
3. Allow the admin to choose the feed item layout.
4. Integrate the urls with BitLy to track how many people visited the various feed items displayed so that we know what people like reading about.
